    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "I have designed the \"Willamette University Campus Navigation System\". This system uses data from a [custom Google MyMap](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1O_JqDQIKP5n6X-zYpz5eD82XSd32ips&ll=44.93743410606265%2C-123.03185815866438&z=16) I created of the Willamette University campus. Pins represent building entrances/exits and paths represent walkways. The data is exported as a KML file, and updates live as changes are made to the MyMap through a web-link. This data is read in to a custom Graph datastructure defined in [graph.py](./Willamette%20University%20Campus%20Navigation%20System/graph.py), wherein the locations and paths are converted to Nodes and connected accordingly. Weights are calculated using the longitude and latitude of each node using functionality from the geopy library. Defined in [pathfinding_algorithms.py](./Willamette%20University%20Campus%20Navigation%20System/pathfinding_algorithms.py) are custom implementations of the dijkstra's, greedy best-first search, and A* pathfinding algorithms. Through the console-based UI, the user can select two locations on campus and a pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm is used to calculate the path between the locations, and the distance in feet and estimated walking time are output. The user is then given the option to visualize the path on a map, which will generate and open an HTML file displaying the path using functionality from the folium library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality has been included to load other MyMap files, including KMZ files which can be converted to KML files using the convert_to_kml function included in the [kmz_extract.py](./Willamette%20University%20Campus%20Navigation%20System/kmz_extract.py) file."
